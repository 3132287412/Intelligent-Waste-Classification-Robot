This project implements an intelligent waste classification robot based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection framework. The system integrates computer vision with real-time control to automatically identify and classify various types of waste (such as plastic, paper, metal, etc.), enabling efficient and automated waste sorting. It is designed with a combination of software (AI model, control logic) and hardware (robotic arm, camera module), making it suitable for practical deployment in smart recycling scenarios.
